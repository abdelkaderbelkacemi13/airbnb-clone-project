## üíæ Database Design Overview

The database is modeled around five core entities that manage the platform's listings, users, and transactions. This relational structure ensures data integrity and scalability.

### Key Entities and Fields

* **1. Users** (The foundation of the platform)
    * `user_id` (Primary Key)
    * `email` (Unique, for login and communication)
    * `password_hash` (Secured storage of credentials)
    * `is_host` (Boolean flag)
    * `created_at`

* **2. Properties** (The available listings)
    * `property_id` (Primary Key)
    * `title`
    * `host_id` (Foreign Key to **Users**)
    * `location` (City, State, Country)
    * `daily_price`

* **3. Bookings** (The transaction record)
    * `booking_id` (Primary Key)
    * `user_id` (Foreign Key to **Users** - the guest)
    * `property_id` (Foreign Key to **Properties**)
    * `check_in_date`
    * `check_out_date`

* **4. Reviews** (User feedback)
    * `review_id` (Primary Key)
    * `user_id` (Foreign Key to **Users** - the reviewer)
    * `property_id` (Foreign Key to **Properties**)
    * `rating` (e.g., 1 to 5)
    * `comment`

* **5. Payments** (Financial record)
    * `payment_id` (Primary Key)
    * `booking_id` (Foreign Key to **Bookings**)
    * `amount`
    * `status` (e.g., Pending, Completed, Refunded)
    * `transaction_date`

### Entity Relationships

* **Users** ‚Üî **Properties**: A one-to-many relationship. A **User** can be a host for many **Properties**, but each **Property** is hosted by only one **User**.
* **Users** ‚Üî **Bookings**: A one-to-many relationship. A **User** can create many **Bookings**.
* **Properties** ‚Üî **Bookings**: A one-to-many relationship. A **Property** can have many **Bookings** over time.
* **Bookings** ‚Üî **Payments**: A one-to-one relationship. Each **Booking** results in exactly one **Payment** record for tracking.
* **Users** ‚Üî **Reviews** ‚Üî **Properties**: A many-to-many relationship. A **User** can leave many **Reviews**, and a **Property** can receive many **Reviews**.

## ‚ú® Feature Breakdown

This project centers around the implementation of key functional modules that mirror the essential user experience and business logic of a real-world booking platform.

* **1. User Management & Authentication**
    This feature handles user registration, secure login, profile management, and role differentiation (guest vs. host). It is fundamental to the application, ensuring that users can securely interact with the platform and that all actions are properly authorized.

* **2. Property Listing & Search**
    This module allows hosts to create, edit, and manage their property listings (including location, pricing, and amenities) and enables guests to search and filter available properties. It forms the core inventory system of the platform, connecting supply (hosts) with demand (guests).

* **3. Booking System & Availability**
    The core transactional feature that allows guests to reserve properties for specific date ranges, checking against the property‚Äôs availability. This complex module handles date validation, prevents double-booking, and locks in the transaction.

* **4. Review and Rating System**
    This feature allows users to submit feedback and numerical ratings after a booking is completed. It contributes to platform trust and quality control by providing social proof for properties, which influences future booking decisions.

* **5. Payment Processing & Tracking**
    This module manages the financial lifecycle of a booking, ensuring secure capture of payment details and tracking transaction statuses. It is crucial for the business model, connecting the `Bookings` entity to the necessary `Payments` record.

* **6. API Implementation (GraphQL)**
    The entire application functionality will be exposed via a high-performance, flexible GraphQL API. This ensures efficient data retrieval for the client application and demonstrates proficiency in building modern, scalable communication layers.

## üõ°Ô∏è API Security Overview

API security is paramount for a platform handling sensitive personal information and financial transactions. A multi-layered defense strategy will be implemented to protect endpoints and user data.

### Key Security Measures

| Measure | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Authentication (JWT/Token)** | Verifying the identity of users and hosts before allowing API access. This ensures that only logged-in users can perform state-changing actions like creating a booking or listing a property. |
| **Authorization (Permissions)** | Ensuring that an authenticated user can **only** access or modify resources they own. For example, a host can only edit their own properties, and a guest can only view their own booking details. |
| **Rate Limiting** | Controlling the number of requests a user can make to the API within a specific timeframe. This defends against **Denial of Service (DoS)** attacks and prevents API abuse, ensuring service stability for all users. |
| **Data Validation/Sanitization** | Strictly validating and cleaning all input received from API requests. This is the primary defense against injection attacks (like SQL or GraphQL injection) that target the database. |
| **HTTPS/SSL Enforcement** | Encrypting all data transmitted between the client and the server using SSL/TLS. This ensures that sensitive information, such as login credentials and payment tokens, cannot be intercepted in transit. |

### Crucial Security Areas

* **User Data Protection:** Encryption and secure hashing (`password_hash` field) are used to protect PII (Personally Identifiable Information) stored in the **Users** entity, maintaining user trust and privacy.
* **Securing Payments:** Authentication and Authorization are critical to ensuring only the appropriate user can initiate or view a transaction, preventing unauthorized financial activity linked to the **Payments** entity.
* **Property Integrity:** Robust authorization is required to prevent a malicious user from modifying or deleting another host's **Properties** or listings, maintaining data integrity across the platform.

## üöÄ CI/CD Pipeline Overview

**Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Delivery (CD)** are crucial practices for modern, scalable software development, ensuring rapid and reliable deployment.

### Purpose and Importance

A **CI/CD Pipeline** automates the steps required to get code changes from the developer's repository to the production environment. For this project, it is essential because it guarantees that code is **constantly tested** (CI) for quality and immediately deployable (CD) upon merging. This automation drastically reduces the risk of human error, enables faster iteration cycles, and supports the collaborative nature of the development team.

### Tools for Implementation

* **GitHub Actions:** Serves as the primary CI/CD orchestration tool, defining the sequence of jobs (e.g., build, test, deploy) that run automatically upon code commits and merges.
* **Docker:** Used for **containerization**, ensuring that the application environment (including Django and its dependencies) is consistent across the pipeline stages. Docker images guarantee that what works in development will work identically in production.
